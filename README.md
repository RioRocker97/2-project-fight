## What is this project about ?
The initial name for this project is "Project_Fight". Project_Fight is an interactive game app that
let user find nearby person to set an online fight match through my application.

Project_Fight has implemented Mutithread and Socket programming that had been previously taught in the class.

Project_Fight is not my personal serious android development project due to short development time and lack of android application development knowledges.So, Please dont take my app too serious .

Project_Fight should have the following feature
 - view User Profile (Mutithreading for faster processing **Use Asynchronus Programming instead) :ok_hand:
 - Basic fighting match (Socket Programming) ** Chatiing had been dropped out :writing_hand:
 - 2D mini-game for (fake) online fighting :writing_hand:
