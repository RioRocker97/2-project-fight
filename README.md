## What is this project about ?
The initial name for this project is "Project_Fight". Project_Fight is an interactive game app that
let user find nearby person to set an online fight match through my application.

Project_Fight has implemented Mutithread and Socket programming that had been previously taught in the class.

Project_Fight is not my personal serious android development project due to short development time and lack of android application development knowledges.So, Please dont take my app too serious .

Project_Fight should have the following feature
 - User Profile
 - Basic Chatting to set the date for a fight match
 - 2D mini-game for online fighting
